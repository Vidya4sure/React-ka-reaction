## JSX and why it looks like html

- `JSX` stands for `JavaScript XML`
- JSX uses a combination of both `XML type syntax` and `JavaScript`.
- `XML (Extensive Markup Language)` is a way to store and transport data between different computer systems.
- Since `XML` looks like `HTML` (both are markup languages) thats why `JSX` also have similar syntax.
- JSX is not HTML, JSX code gets converted into regular HTML, CSS and JS code before it runs in the browser.

This is how JSX code looks like:

```jsx
// Both HTML and JS combined into JSX
const UserCard = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h2> {props.name} </h2>
      <p> Email: {props.email} </p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

> üí° Note: `JSX` is not required for using `React`, it's used because it makes UI development in React easier.

## Babel Compiler

Since browsers can not understand react code, this code is `transpiled` into javascript code which could be understood by `JS Engine`.

`Parcel` uses `babel (JS compiler)` for transpilation.

`JSX` => `React.createElement (JS Object)` => `rendered as HTML code`

It converts new generation javascript code into browser compatible javascript.

> Note: Parcel uses babel behind the scenes but Vite doesnt use it, instead Vite directly supports native ES6 module approach so it doesnt rely on Babel.

Under the hood: `react` -> `compiler/transpiler` (npm run build) -> `html, css, js`

## State

An object representing the current state of the application. It represents dynamic things in your app (that change).

for exp:

```js
// object
const counterState = {
  counter: 1,
};

const linkedinTopBarState = {
  topbar: {
    home: 0,
    notifications: 14,
    jobs: 0,
  },
};
```

So any values that is dynamic on the page and might change is the `state`.

## Components

- A reusable part of a website / a component of a website.

- Components are reusable building blocks that we can use to create the different parts of web page.

- Components are independent and reusable in nature. Each component encapsulates its own logic, structure, and styling, and can be composed together with other components to create complex UI.

- Any part of the website that can change given a `state`
  - give a state of app
  - give components
  - give how states are connected to the components
  - react will take care of rerendering it

## Rerendering

Updating the state and rerender (changing the DOM)

`'A state change'` triggers rerendering of DOM elements.

We define component once and when the state changes it triggers the rerendering phase and react takes care of rerendering.

## Types of Components

1. `Functional Component`: New way (more preferred)
2. `Class Based Component`: Old way

## Functional Components

```jsx
// a function that return react elements is a functional component
// they start with a capital letter
const HeadingComp = () => {
  return (
    <div className = "container">
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
    </div>
  )
};

const ParagraphComp = () => (
  <div>
    <p> A paragraph </p>
  </div>
);

```

## Components vs. React Elements
```jsx
// this is a react element, it doesn't return anything
const headingElement = (
  <h1 className="heading">Hello world in React!</h1>
)

// this is a react functional component
const HeadingComp = () => {
  return <h1>This is a heading component</h1>
}

const HeadingComp = () => (
  <h1>This is a heading component</h1>
)

// The render() method in ReactDOM expects a React element, 
// which can be a component or a simple JSX element.

 // render a react element 
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render (
 headingElement
);

// render a component
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render (
 <HeadingComp />
);

```
## Component Composition

`Component Composition` in React refers to the practice of building complex user interfaces by combining and nesting multiple simpler components together.

```jsx
const Title = () => {
  return ( 
    <h1 className="heading">
      Welcome to my React App!
    </h1>
  )
}

const Paragraph = () => {
  return ( 
    <p className="para">
      This is a paragraph component.
    </p>
  )
}

// nesting Title and Paragraph inside Heading
const Heading = () => {
  return <div id="container">
    <Title />
    <Paragraph />
  </div>
};
```

## Injecting JavaScript inside JSX

We use `{}` to inject any javascript code inside jsx.

for example:

```jsx
const titleElement = (
    <h1 className="heading">
      Welcome to my React App!
    </h1>
)

// nesting Title and Paragraph inside Heading
const Heading = () => {
  return <div id="container">
    {titleElement}
  </div>
};
```

## Infinite Component Composition Loop
Nesting `Title` inside `Heading` and `Heading` inside `Title`. Basically an infinite loop.

```jsx
const Title = () => ( 
  <h1 className="heading">
    Welcome to my React App!
    <Heading/> 
  </h1>
)

const Heading = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title />
  </div>
);
```

> üìù Note: Since we can nest anything inside anything thats why it's important to remember the foundations of `sementic HTML` and how html should be rendered otherwise we might end up creating very bad html page which is not good for `SEO` and `Accessibility`.
